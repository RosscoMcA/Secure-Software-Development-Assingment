To Run the application: 

You will require Visual studio 2015 or above with facilities for ASP.net development & entity framework. You will also require microsoft ISS. When running the application, do not start up on a view as this may cause the system to crash.
Start on a controller or any other page.

Alternatively, I can host the application through azure web services at your request.
